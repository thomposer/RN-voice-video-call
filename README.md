# RNVideoVoiceCall

**RNVideoVoiceCall** is the 4th session build for showing the implementation of Signin and Signup screen to login or create user for voice call along with video call for both peer to peer or conference using Voximplant for react native

In this branch, we will be focusing on The Backend part using fetching of response and taking the json elements where we will setup Voximplant to login with the main user account, create a child user or login with the already assigned user , assign the user to certain new or previous application and enter the view.

**Note:**

1. The response's JSON maybe required to be stringified, so make usre you use it when formatting
2. As the react-native-voximplant package sends responses as the state of the account is changed, we use DeviceEventEmitter for listening and changing certain variables

Next, we store the login values or the new user create values locally using Async Storage and then use it next time the user opens the app so that s/he does not have to login each time the app is opened.

We will be using HTTPAPI of Voximplant.
